            <h1>I'm Raj Krishna Charalingal</h1>
            <h3>Full Stack Software Engineer</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p>I started my career in wipro as a test engineer as fresher post my engineering.
             With the passion to be developer I moved to development using java almost after 1.5-2 year.
             From there I begun my journey as a software engineer/developer . In my 9 years career, I  have been part of both service
             based and product based companies.<br></br> I have a relevant experience of 5 years in java based backend
             development and 3 years of experience in front end devlopment (as a full stack developer) using 
             Javascript and its popular framework React JS.<br></br>
             Among the back end framework ,I have a good command on Java with Spring MVC and Spring Boot and a basic idea of microservice 
             architecture based on spring cloud.
             As far Devops area is considered,I am aquainted with devops tools like Jenkins and container like Docker.
             In addition , I have been exposed to and have a basic knowledge on Google Cloud Platform .
             Lastly, I have worked in an agile atmosphere, with scrum as the methodology.

             I  embrace learning as my passion in the career ahead, and to be part of teams which will enrich my knowledge 
             and let me earn higher expertise in complex development.
